# 🖼️ Image Classification: CNN-Based Cat and Dog Recognition

This project is designed to classify images as **cat or dog** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. To enhance model performance, steps such as **data preprocessing, model selection, and hyperparameter optimization** have been applied.

The model will be trained using **train and validation datasets**, and the test dataset will only be used in the final evaluation phase. This ensures that the model's **generalization ability** is measured while minimizing the risk of **overfitting**.
